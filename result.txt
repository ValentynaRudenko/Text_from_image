EMERGENCY PROCEDURES CHAPTER 16
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT DEALING WITH EMERGENCIES BEGINS WITH PROTECTING ONE'S OWN SAFETY AS well as the safety of others and the victim. When administering first aid, a personal trainer should start by wearing personal protective equipment (PPE). Gloves are a universal standard and should be worn in all cases but other equipment; such as eye protection and mask may also be necessary to avoid the possible transfer of pathogens (microorganisms that cause disease) (Mistovich & Karren, 2013). Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis are the bloodborne diseases of most concern to a personal trainer. Universal precautions state that everyone is to be treated as if he or she is infected, and first responders should always avoid contact with victim's bodily fluids [American Heart Association (AHA), 2011] (see "Universal Precautions and Protection Against Bloodborne Pathogens' page 631 for more information)_
SCENE SAFETY SCENE SAFETY REQUIRES KNOWING WHEN IT IS SAFE TO APPROACH A VICTIM and when it is not: For example, people are sometimes struck and killed the road while trying to help at the scene of an accident: Other dangerous situations might involve smoke-filled building; downed power lines; hazardous materials a crime in progress or unstable surfaces such as a car on its side. If in doubt; a potential rescuer should wait for trained help to arrive as he or she can make the situation much worse by becoming another victim. For personal trainers, scene safety requires situational awareness whether training clients in the gym or in their homes (Mistovich & Karren, 2013). What are the potential hazards? Is there first-aid kit or an automated external defibrillator (AED) on the premises? Where is the nearest phone or is there cell phone coverage in the area? Where is the nearest hospital? Are there others nearby who can help in case of an emergency?
APPLY WHAT YOU KNOW
MAINTAINING A FIRST-AID KIT first-aid kit should be systematically maintained and stocked with the following supplies: For airway management: CPR microshield or pocket mask with one-way valve for protected mouth-to mouth ventilations (Figure 16-1)
Figure 16-1 Mouth-to-mask ventilations: mask with one-way valve prevents contact with victim' face during mouth-to-mouth resuscitation. Small pocket masks are also effective, inexpensive, and convenient:
